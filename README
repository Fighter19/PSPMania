1, Whats this?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is that "StepMania 3.9" that is as famous for DDR simulator is transplanted for PSP.

  For more information on StepMania, please see http://www.stepmania.com/.
  Especially, anyone who hasnt yet played StepMania should see the site.
  This text is written only about differences from "Stepmania 3.9".

  This game is...
    * I wanna use cool skins.
    * I wanna play with different options.
  If stated above requests are applied, this game will be recommended.

  If following requests are applied, PSPRevolution will be recommended.
    * I fuss over about skins.
    * I dont use many options.
    * I wanna play smoothly.

  Specifications may change in the future.

  Whatever happened, i dont take any responsibility for that.
  After understanding above, please go the introduction and play.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2, Minimum Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * PSP-2000 (required CFW)
  * PSP-3000 (required CFW)
  * PSP go Å@(required CFW)
  I dont know HBL and VHBL well.

  Though you can even boot on PSP-1000 and unmodified PSP, this game may not work well.
  This is because they arent allowed to use the ExtraMemory.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3, Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Copy "PSPMania" folder to PSP/GAME/.
  When you add songs, please have enough free space in your device to create their caches.
  It takes a long time on creating caches. (ex. about 30 minutes at 700 songs)

  You can use smzip format, but it doesnt be recommended.
  The format will cause the out of memory and the processing fall.

4, Differences from Stepmania
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A CPU clock option was added at MachineOptions. But it doesnt work on ME series.

  By default, Enter=START ESC=SELECT.
  If you take a screenshot, push analog stick down with pressing RL Trigger.

  The following features are not supported.
    * Encryption profile (deleted because program size will be bloated) 
    * Creation and Editing of songs (deleted because PSP doesnt have enough buttons)
    * Korean at KSF (character code conversion problem)
    * 3D character (not implemented)
    * Battle (not implemented)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5, Known Bugs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * The processing fall
    May improve if turn plug-in off.

  * In some cases this game may unexpectedly quit due to lack of memory.

  * GrooveRader and LifeBar are not displayed well.
    They are under investigation at present.

  * Default skin is so rough :P
    I hope more and more people create skins.

6, On Creating Skins
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  It is better to use 256 palette colors (indexed colors).
  It saves memory and drawing is fast.
  ScreenEdit cannot be used.
  It is better to use WAV format at SE, because it doesnt need to be decoded.
  Arrow size is 36px at present.

7, FAQ
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Was returned to the XMB(the menu screen of PSP) suddenly.
    Read a log file in the root directory of your device.

  Strange sound or sound quality is poor.
    This is because the sampling frequency is not 44100Hz. Convert it to 44100Hz.

  I wanna share songs with PSP Revolution.
    You can use AdditionalSongFolders at Data/StepMania.ini.
    ex1.                AdditionalSongFolders=../PSPRevolution v0.4/Songs/
    ex2(except PSP go). AdditionalSongFolders=ms0:/PSP/GAME/PSPRevolution v0.4/Songs/
    ex3(only PSP go).   AdditionalSongFolders=ef0:/PSP/GAME/PSPRevolution v0.4/Songs/

  Is a strange background.
    Delete video files at the song folder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
