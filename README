1, Whats this?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is StepMania 3.9, a famous rhythm game simulator, ported to the PSP.

  For more information on StepMania, please see http://www.stepmania.com/.
  Anyone who hasn't played StepMania before should visit the site.
  This file mainly goes into the differences from the PC StepMania 3.9.

  You should use this if the following applies to you:
    * I want to use cool skins.
    * I want to play with different options.

  If these matter more to you, we recomment PSPRevolution instead:
    * I fuss over about skins.
    * I don't use many options.
    * I want to play smoothly.

  Specifications may change in the future.

  I don't take any responsibility for any problems that may arise.
  Once you understand the above, please read the introduction and go play.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2, Minimum Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * PSP-2000
  * PSP-3000
  * PSP Go
  Requires CFW, CFW or HEN installation.
  I don't know HBL and VHBL well.

  Though you can boot on PSP-1000 and even an unmodified PSP, this game may
  not work well. This is because they aren't allowed to use the ExtraMemory.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3, Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Copy "PSPMania" folder to PSP/GAME/.
  When you add songs, please have enough free space in your device to create
  the cache files. It takes a long time to creating caches.
  (ex. about 30 minutes for 700 songs)

  You can use smzip format, but it's not recommended.
  The format will cause out of memory errors and the program may crash.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4, Differences from Stepmania
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A CPU clock option was added at MachineOptions. But it doesn't work on ME series.

  By default, Enter=START and ESC=SELECT.
  To take a screenshot, push analog stick down while pressing RL Trigger.

  The following features are not supported.
    * Profile encryption (deleted because program size will be bloated)
    * Editing/Creation of songs (deleted because PSP doesn't have enough buttons)
    * Korean characters in KSF files (character code conversion problem)
    * 3D characters (not implemented)
    * Battle Mode (not implemented)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5, Known Bugs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * The processing fall
    May improve if turn plug-in off.

  * In some cases this game may unexpectedly quit due to lack of memory.

  * GrooveRadar and LifeBar are not displayed correctly.
    They are currently under investigation.

  * Default skin is so rough :P
    I hope more and more people create skins.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6, On Creating Skins
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * It's better to use 256 palette colors (indexed colors).
    It saves memory and drawing is fast.

  * ScreenEdit cannot be used.

  * It's better to use WAV format for sound effects because it doesn't
    need to be decoded.

  * Arrow size is currently 36px.

  Q. Was returned to the XMB(the menu screen of PSP) suddenly.
  A. Read a log file in the root directory of your device.

8, About Source Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  To build, need to install PSPSDK.
  I use Minimalist PSPSDK for Windows(http://sourceforge.net/projects/minpspw/) 0.11
  on Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express.
